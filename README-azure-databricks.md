## Typical Azure Infrastructure: Developer Environments**

Azure now provides **Azure Deployment Environments** (ADE), which are designed to let platform teams define, automate, and standardize how developers spin up cloud-based workspaces and sandboxes[1][2][3][4][5][8].

### **How It Works**

- **Platform engineers** set up a **Dev Center** in Azure, which acts as a control plane for developer environments.
- **Catalogs** (often GitHub repos) are attached to the Dev Center. These contain environment definitions—typically as infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates (Bicep, ARM, or Terraform), but can also include Dockerfiles, devcontainer.json, and setup scripts[1][4][7].
- **Projects** are created for teams or business units, inheriting settings from the Dev Center. Projects define which environment types (dev, test, prod, etc.) are available, what resources can be provisioned, and what templates are accessible[1][4][5].
- **Developers** can self-serve: using the Azure portal, CLI, or Developer CLI, they spin up environments based on these templates. These environments can be pre-configured VMs, containers, or even managed services, and can run your devcontainer-based setup, justfiles, and bootstrap scripts[1][4][5].

### **Mapping Your Setup**

- Your **devcontainer.json**, Dockerfile, and justfile can be included in the catalog repo attached to the Dev Center.
- When a developer creates an environment, Azure provisions the resources (e.g., VM, container), clones your repo, and runs your setup scripts—just as in Codespaces or Gitpod.
- Permissions, identities, and access are managed via Azure roles and managed identities, ensuring secure and auditable environment creation[1][4][5].

## Databricks on Azure: Notebook & Workflow Environments**

Databricks on Azure is a managed Spark platform, but it’s also extensible for custom development workflows[9][10][11].

### **How It Works**

- **Databricks Workspaces**: These provide interactive notebooks, jobs, and compute clusters.
- **Custom Environments**: You can customize cluster environments using **init scripts**, custom Docker images, or by specifying libraries (Python, R, Java, etc.).
- **Integration with Azure DevOps/ADE**: You can use ADE or DevOps pipelines to provision Databricks workspaces, clusters, and attach your code/config as part of the deployment.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Tools like Prefect or Dagster can be used to orchestrate jobs and manage dependencies—these can be triggered from Databricks or external orchestrators[9][11].

### **Mapping Your Setup**

- **Bootstrap Scripts & Justfiles**:  
  - You can include your setup scripts and justfile in the repo that’s synced to Databricks (via Repos or DBFS).
  - For cluster-level customization, use **init scripts** or custom Docker images that run your justfile setup at startup.
- **Dev Containers**:  
  - While Databricks jobs and notebooks don’t use devcontainer.json directly, you can build custom Docker images (with your devcontainer logic) and use them as the base for Databricks clusters.
- **Notebook Parity**:  
  - Your local devcontainer or Codespace can mirror the Python/R/Scala environments used in Databricks, making it easy to develop locally and run at scale in the cloud[9][10][11].

## **Summary Table**

| Environment                | How Your Setup Maps                                      | Automation/Provisioning                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Dev Environments     | devcontainer.json, Dockerfile, justfile in catalog repo | Azure Dev Center + Project + Environment types |
| Azure VMs/Containers       | Dockerfile, justfile, bootstrap scripts                 | ARM/Bicep/Terraform templates                  |
| Azure Databricks           | Init scripts, custom Docker images, justfile            | Databricks Repos, cluster init, workflows      |

## **Best Practices**

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Bicep/ARM/Terraform to provision Azure resources and inject your devcontainer/justfile setup.
- **Catalogs & Templates**: Store your setup logic in GitHub repos, and reference them in Azure Deployment Environment catalogs[1][4].
- **Custom Images**: For Databricks, build Docker images with your preferred stack and reference them in cluster configuration.
- **Orchestration**: Use tools like Prefect or Dagster for workflow management across Databricks and other Azure resources[9][11].

---

**In summary:**  
Your devcontainer/justfile-based setup is a great fit for Azure's modern developer infrastructure. It can be used as the foundation for self-service environments in Azure Deployment Environments, as well as for customizing Databricks clusters and notebook environments—ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and automation across local, cloud, and data engineering workflows[1][4][5][9][11].
